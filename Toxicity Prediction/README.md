# Toxicity Prediction
A platform for systematic ADME evaluation of drug molecules, thereby accelerating the drug discovery process.<br>
The platform is avaliable at: http://admet.scbdd.com 
(Note: the pgp-substrate model have been fixed, also the correct model has been updated in webserver)
## Features
1. Well optimized SAR models with better performance than state-of-the-art models.
2. User-friendly interface and easy to use.
3. Support batch computation.
4. Systematically evaluate molecular druggability.
5. Provide constructive suggestions for molecular optimization.
